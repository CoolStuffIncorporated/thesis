Each of the blocks was painted a primary color, giving the city a strangely upbeat rainbow look.\n\nWhile the ambitious project seemed like a good idea at the time, the creators failed to account for the lack of an Angolan middle class able to afford such rentals. With many Angolans living off of no more than $2 a day, the apartments, which cost between $120,000 and $200,000, are simply out of reach. This being the case, only around 20,000 tenants have moved into the project and only one of the schools has opened, and that has to be filled by bussing kids in from other areas.\n\nDespite the troubling lack of tenants, Nova Cidade de Kilamba does seem to be receiving some support from the Angolan government who plans on opening a portion of the apartments to low income housing, estimating that the population could double or more in coming years. Lets hope they have better luck than China’s ghost cities."}%
